      <article>
        <p>As the clocks prepare to strike midnight on December 31, 1999, we at Jeremy Corp remain committed to ensuring uninterrupted access to critical systems, such as the latest information on Game Boy Color games, AOL screen name registries, and our NYSNC forum site. All floppy disks have been triple-backed-up, with copies stored securely in safety deposit boxes, alongside our strategic corporate reserve of Beanie Babies. Short of a robot uprising (a very real possibility) we will be there for you!</p>

        <p>You know what that means -- it's a chill day! So go ahead, strap on your rollerblades at the mall parking lot, blast the latest Destiny's Child album on your Discman, and then head home for some Lunchables and Gushers.</p>
